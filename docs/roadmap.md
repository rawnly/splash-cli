Below you can see some **super cool** steps who this repo needs! :rabbit: 

---
- [ ] Add support for proxed users (See [`proxy`](branch-proxy) branch and [#9](https://github.com/rawnly/splash-cli/issues/9))
- [ ] Review of all docs from someone who know how to write english better than me. 
- [ ] Make _this module_ faster and easier
- [ ] Create a **multiplatform** desktop GUI application (See [autosplash](proj-autosplash), maybe could better without electron)
